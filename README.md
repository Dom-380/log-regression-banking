# 📊 Bank Customer Demographic Analysis with Logistic Regression

Hi there! This repository contains an R-based project that applies logistic regression and statistical analysis to uncover demographic patterns among banking customers who are likely to open a term deposit account.

### 🛠️ Tools Used
- R (tidyverse, readr, ggeffects, ggplot2)
- RStudio
- Public banking dataset (CSV format)

### 🔍 Key Highlights
- Performed data cleaning and preprocessing on bank marketing campaign data
- Applied logistic regression to model the probability of term deposit sign-up
- Interpreted statistical outputs to identify significant demographic predictors
- Visualized results with `ggplot2` and `ggeffects` for interpretability

### 📁 Dataset
I've included the dataset (bank-additional-full.csv) in this repository. Feel free to download the repo and use it in R to explore, analyze, or reproduce the logistic regression results.
