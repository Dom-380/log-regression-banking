# 📊 Bank Customer Demographic Analysis with Logistic Regression

Hi there! This repository contains an R-based project that applies logistic regression and statistical analysis to uncover demographic patterns among banking customers who are likely to open a term deposit account.

### 🛠️ Tools Used
- R (tidyverse, readr, ggeffects, ggplot2)
- RStudio
- Public banking dataset (CSV format)

### 🔍 Key Highlights
- Performed data cleaning and preprocessing on bank marketing campaign data
- Applied logistic regression to model the probability of term deposit sign-up
- Interpreted statistical outputs to identify significant demographic predictors
- Visualized results with `ggplot2` and `ggeffects` for interpretability

### 📁 Dataset
This analysis uses a publicly available **Bank Marketing** dataset from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing) (or update this if from another source).  
Please download the CSV and place it in the `/data` folder to reproduce results.
